## Raw data 

Historical weather data from a Met Ã‰ireann Oak Park synoptic weather station was used for model evaluation. The trial sites were in the radius of up to 500 m from the station in all years. 

## Data wrangling

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library("tidyverse")
#Weather data, parameters and cut off dates
files <- list.files("./data/", recursive = T, pattern = "Birr|Cas|Kil")
df_list <- lapply(files, function(x)  
  df_fun <- read_csv(paste0("./data/", x))
)

#Load&merge data for Casement station
df<-read.table("./data/hlydata2000_3723.txt", 
                     header=T,
                     stringsAsFactors=F, 
                     sep = ",")
glimpse(df)

```
The original files were modified as following. The names of the variables were changed to.. The original wide format was retained and will be transformed using the dplyr functions, etc.

## Glimpse 

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#Weather data, parameters and cut off dates

```
